description: When working on editing the "Awesome Tools" list
---

Awesome tools is inspired by `awesome-*` style lists available on GitHub. If asked to add a new entry, determine the best category for that entry to fall under. If no good category exists, create a new one. Try to use existing categories for organization.

For each entry, write 1-3 sentences describing the tool or project.

Be sure to alphabetize the entries within a category, and the categories themselves.
